## Features
- **OCR & AI**: Converts academic PDFs into markdown. Still a work in development.
- **Markdown Compatibility**: Renders tables and formulas in Mathpix Markdown format.
- **Self-installs Nougat**: If Nougat is not detected, it will install automatically.
- **Link to install PyTorch**: PyTorch improves performance. If PyTorch is not detected, it will display a link for download.
- **Update button**: Nougat and NougatGUI are in development. The Update button will keep you up-to-date.

## How to Use
1. **Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
2. **Download the [NougatGUI.py](https://github.com/sm18lr88/Nougat-GUI/blob/main/NougatGUI.py) file**
3. **Run**: Open terminal and run `python NougatGUI.py`. If you don't have Nougat already installed, give it some time to do so.
5. **Optimization**: For faster performance, install PyTorch. Click the link in the app to visit the install page for PyTorch.
6. **Output**: Choose markdown compatibility for .mmd files, which you can open as a regular .md or .txt file.
7. **Error Handling**: Use "Recompute" to force the app to work on the file ignoring data from previous attempts.
